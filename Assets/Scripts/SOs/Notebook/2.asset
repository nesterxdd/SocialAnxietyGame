  info: "I'll find a quiet spot then close my eyes and start thinking about my breath,
    taking slow, deep breaths in through my nose and out through my mouth. \n\nNext,
    I'll notice things around me, like the feeling of my feet on the ground, the
    sounds I hear, or the things I can see. I'll remember that I don't have to stop
    my anxiety all at once, focusing on one breath at a time and trusting that I'll
    start to feel better bit by bit."
