  info: "When I feel really worried, I can use the 5-4-3-2-1 trick to calm down.
    First, I look around and find 5 things I can see. Then, I touch 4 things around
    me. Next, I listen carefully and notice 3 things I can hear. \n\nAfter that,
    I try to smell 2 things. Finally, I think about 1 thing I can taste. This helps
    me stop thinking about what\u2019s making me nervous and focus on what's happening
    right now."
