  header: The Snuggles of Dogs
  info: 'There''s nothing quite like snuggling up with a dog. Their warm, soft fur
    and gentle breathing can turn any couch or bed into the coziest spot on earth.
    Dogs love to cuddle, and their affectionate nature makes them perfect snuggle
    buddies.

    

    Whether it''s a chilly winter evening or a lazy Sunday
    morning, dogs are always up for some quality cuddle time. '
