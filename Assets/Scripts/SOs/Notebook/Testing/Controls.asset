  header: The Loyalty of Dogs
  info: 'Dogs are famously loyal creatures, always sticking by their humans through
    thick and thin. Their unwavering dedication is evident in how they greet us with
    excitement every time we walk through the door, even if we''ve only been gone
    for five minutes.


    This loyalty is like having a best friend who never lets
    you down.'
