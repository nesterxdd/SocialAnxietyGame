  info: 'Having a dog is a great motivator to stay active. Dogs love their walks,
    and having a furry exercise buddy can make daily strolls much more enjoyable.
    Whether it''s a quick walk around the block or a hike through the woods, dogs
    ensure we get our daily dose of exercise.

    

    Playing fetch, running
    in the park, or even just chasing your dog around the yard can be a fun way to
    stay fit.'
