  header: The Intelligence of Dogs
  info: 'Dogs are incredibly smart and can learn a variety of tricks and commands.
    From fetching the newspaper to performing complex agility courses, their intelligence
    is truly impressive. It''s like having a furry little genius in your home who
    can solve problems and follow instructions.

    

    Beyond tricks, dogs
    can understand our emotions and react accordingly. They know when we''re happy,
    sad, or upset, and they respond with empathy. '
