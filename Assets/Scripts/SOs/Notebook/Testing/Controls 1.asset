  header: Dogs as Therapy Animals
  info: 'Dogs have a magical ability to make us feel better, which is why they''re
    perfect therapy animals. They intuitively know when we need comfort, often resting
    their heads on our laps or offering a paw to hold. Their presence alone can turn
    a bad day into a good one.

    

    Therapy dogs bring joy and calm to hospitals,
    schools, and nursing homes. It''s amazing how just petting a dog can make stress
    melt away and bring a smile to anyone''s face. '
