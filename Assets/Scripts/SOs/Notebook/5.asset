  header: Seeking Support
  info: "Seeking support is something I\u2019ve learned is really important in dealing
    with my social anxiety. Talking to someone I trust\u2014whether it\u2019s a close
    friend, a family member, or a therapist\u2014can make a big difference. \n\nJust
    having someone who listens without judgement and understands what I\u2019m going
    through can be so comforting."
