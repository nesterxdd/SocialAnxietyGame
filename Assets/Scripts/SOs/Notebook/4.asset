  info: "Today, I was reminded by someone wise to approach my social anxiety one
    step at a time. They suggested starting with simpler tasks, like chatting with
    a friend or joining a small group activity. \n\nIt\u2019s reassuring to know
    that progress is about appreciating every little achievement and moving forward
    at my own pace, learning and growing along the journey."
