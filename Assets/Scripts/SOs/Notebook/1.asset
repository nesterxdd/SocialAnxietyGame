  info: 'Today is the big day at the Anime Con and I have so much stuff I want to
    do. I get really uncomfortable around large groups of people so I need to be
    careful otherwise I''ll get a panic attack.


    The more I talk to others though,
    the more confidence I will gain so maybe by the end of the day I will be able
    to go wherever I want. Good thing I have my Map (M), Journal (J) and notebook
    (N) to keep me on track!'
